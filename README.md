This repository contains the laboratory reports and code files for the Optoelectronics Laboratory course (EEE 460). The experiments cover fundamental concepts of optoelectronics including light absorption and emission, semiconductor behavior, LED characterization, solar cell analysis, and laser fundamentals.

## Experiments Overview

### Experiment 1: Light Absorption and Emission Properties of Materials
Explored the theoretical absorption coefficients of various semiconductor materials (GaAs, Si, InP, SiO2) by considering dispersion and direct/forbidden transitions. Implemented numerical calculations to compare with experimental results, and analyzed temperature dependence using Varshni's relation. Also calculated spontaneous emission rates and compared theoretical predictions with published literature.

### Experiment 2: Reflection, Transmission, Radiative and Non-Radiative Recombination
Calculated reflection and transmission coefficients for light incident on semiconductors of varying thicknesses. Analyzed radiative and non-radiative recombination rates in semiconductors and determined the internal quantum efficiency of materials based on these rates. Explored how defect density affects performance characteristics.

### Experiment 3: Characterization of Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs)
Performed a comprehensive analysis of LED characteristics including spontaneous emission spectra, injection efficiency, radiative recombination efficiency, and extraction efficiency. Compared the performance of GaAs and GaN LEDs, and analyzed their I-V characteristics under various conditions. Calculations confirmed the theoretical understanding of LED behavior.

### Experiment 5: Study of Ideal and Practical Solar Cells
Analyzed the I-V and P-V characteristics of silicon solar cells under varying conditions. Investigated the effects of solar irradiance, ideality factor, and temperature on cell performance metrics including fill factor, efficiency, and maximum power output. Also examined the impact of parasitic resistances (series and parallel) on overall cell performance.

### Experiment 6: Measurement and Analysis of I-V Characteristics of Solar Panels and Cells
Experimentally measured the I-V characteristics of commercial solar panels and individual cells. Calculated key performance parameters including fill factor, efficiency, series and shunt resistances. Compared nameplate specifications with measured performance and analyzed discrepancies under real-world operating conditions.

### Experiment 7: Measurement of Output Characteristics of a Light Source Using Spectroradiometer
Used a spectroradiometer to analyze a commercial LED bulb, measuring its spectral distribution, luminous flux, and color rendering index (CRI). Calculated luminous efficacy and compared with different light source technologies. Analyzed the correlated color temperature (CCT) and determined its practical lighting applications.

### Experiment 8: Measurement and Analysis of L-I Characteristics of LEDs
Experimentally measured the light output power versus current (L-I) characteristics of different colored LEDs. Calculated and analyzed external quantum efficiency (EQE), power conversion efficiency (PCE), and luminous efficacy (LE). Compared experimental results with recent literature on advanced LED technologies like perovskite LEDs.

### Experiment 9: Measurement and Analysis of Spectral Characteristics of LEDs
Measured the spectral characteristics of different colored LEDs, analyzing peak wavelength, linewidth (FWHM), and intensity variations with current. Observed the behavior of green, red, white, and yellow LEDs and related their performance to underlying semiconductor physics. Used a fiber optic spectrometer for precise spectral measurements.
